    "reviewText": "After I wrote the below review, the manufacturer contacted me and explained how to use this.  Instead of the (current) picture on Amazon where the phone is placed vertically, you actually use the stand with the phone placed horizontally.  Then the charge / sync cable goes through the hole and you can charge from the side.  When used in landscape position this stand does make more sense so I'm upgrading this review from 2 stars to 4 stars (which I rarely do, but in this case user error) with a star off for lack of documentation.  Manufacturer has said he will include directions and I would also encourage him to update the photos on Amazon with more examples of how this can be used.  The wood quality is indeed good and it's a sturdy little stand.  I'm trying to think of when I'd actually use this stand... perhaps for Facetime chats.  I also think it would be useful for someone in an open office environment if they want to keep their phone on their desk and see alerts / notifications easily.  Hope this updated review helps.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI am throwing this stand in the garbage.  While it's crafted of a nice wood, it is not functional as near as I can tell.  It does not come with instructions and as you can see from the product description, even that is confusing since the English is poorly translated Chinese.  The iPhone sits on the stand just fine, but when it's on the stand, there is no way the plug on the bottom  will plug in -- the stand blocks it.  If you turn the iPhone over, the plug is on the top, which just looks strange.  And I'm not at all sure what the hole in the back of the stand is supposed to do.  Also included are four plastic feet, again no instructions, so I affixed them to the bottom of the stand and it began to wobble.\n\nPerhaps someone else will figure out how to work this thing and post a review, but as far as I'm concerned, the out of the box experience was terrible.\n\nSorry, I cannot recommend.\n\nSample provided in exchange for an honest review.",

Mine unscrewed halfway during use. But, I realized it was probably mostly because I kept twisting the hose around. Also, it easily screwed back in and can probably be held in place with a little duct/electrical tape.\n-The storage bag is slightly small, but ONLY by a tiny bit. The current size makes storing all the pieces a bit of a jigsaw challenge to get everything to fit properly. This is only a comment for future upgrade improvements as everything does fit into the included storage bag.\n\nCustomer service: 5/5 stars\nTo start, I purchased this product with my own money. I believe a company's customer service and confidence in their product is essential to any purchase, big or small. Hotor is one company that deserves the \"Amazon's Choice\" banner that it currently has for this product.

I really use the light on this one often, and the pump is great for getting some air in bike tires when on the go.  The guage is a big plus too.\n\nI use this weekly or every other week to clean dried mud/sand out of the back & front seats that the dogs drag in when I take them for a walk.  With the brush end it gets the dog hairs pretty well too.  They are short haired but do shed little hairs.\n\nWhat I like most is I'm not running to the house for the small shop vac, and running a 100' cord from the trailer house to the car in the parking lot.  Plenty of cord for your own car, and with a simple 25' extension you can easily clean a friend's car from your cig lighter. (Saves on gas with a prius as the generator! :))",

The packaging included (4) thin, clear [possibly silicone] rubber pads which should be installed to prevent the otherwise slippery wood stand from slipping.\n\nThe walnut finish is attractive, and the current photos seen pretty accurate in showing the correct color and finish of the stand.\n\nThe anti-radiation claim is obviously based on simply moving the phone away from one's head.  The wood stand does not appear to have any electromagnetic or electrostatic shielding of any type, and if it did would likely affect the phone operation in a negative way anyway.",

I didn't try the air pump capability but this could come in handy if you get a flat on the road. So It will stay in my car for sure.

Yes, I am yet another reviewer who received this car vac for free from the seller because they needed folks to test this out and review it.  I agreed to test it but I was very skeptical.\n\nHere's the thing.  My car is a dog car.  Make no mistake about it, it is filled with dog hair because they ride in the car and come to work with me more often than not.  They aren't per se huge shedders but the car almost always looks like it's wearing a fur coat.  When I bring it to some of the most sophisticated hand car washes around here they always tell me that they doubt if they can get all the dog hair out.  So, with this little thirty five dollar mini vac I just was not optimistic.\n\nIt did a GOOD job.  The suction doesn't feel very strong and in fact it isn't.  But when I was done, the car looked a good seventy or eighty percent better.  This picked up the dog hair that was loose, no problem.  It struggled a bit to wrest the dog hair away from the carpeted mats but it really did good.  I used the attachments to try to free the trapped fur from the carpeting and also to get into much tighter spots.  By the time I was done my car looked significantly cleaner.  I am impressed.  It could stand to have a bit more suction but honestly it did fine with what suction it did have.  And the cylinder that holds whatever particles  you vacuumed up is very easy to open and clean.  I am so tired of these bagless vac that are so difficult you clean that you end up with everything you vacuumed up right back on the floor.  You won't have that problem with this vacuum\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Is this the best vacuum I've ever used?  No, but it certainly is one of the most practical and easy to use  And it really does a very good job cleaning.  So small and packable that it's easy to just keep in your car and pull out when you need it.  It comes with a little carry bag which fits the vac perfectly and you can even fit the accessories in there.",

First he wondered if they pieces all fit in the bag (they did).  Then he wondered if it could be dismantled for cleaning (it can).\n\nHe took it outside and vacuumed his freshly-washed car....and came back with a vacuum that had picked up a bunch of dirt in his squeaky-clean car.  haha.  (see pic) Now he's hooked!  He went from rolling his eyes to telling me to tell you all that this is a great thing to buy, and a must-have if you are totally uptight like he is.\n\nIt works great, is easy to empty and clean, and everything fits in the bag. :)\n\nMy apologies for how Amazon uploaded my photos.  I'm not sure why this happens from time to time.",

I typically use a shopvac to clean my cars out but that can be a hassle as I need to get extension cords and lug the big vacuum out of the basement. Of course this small vacuum doesn't have the same power as the shopvac but it does do a good job at cleaning up small messes. I like using this small vacuum to clean up small messes as it is very easy to use and I keep this in the trunk. The power cord is fairly long and allows me to reach every part of my car (4 door CTS) without any problems. I have yet to test the wet function of the vacuum, but the dry vacuum works as intended and picks up almost everything in its path. I received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review.",

    "reviewText": "I like this mini vacuum. It's not a replacement for a full size vacuum, but it also isn't huge and doesn't need a long extension cord to get to your car.\n\nI find this is good for minor clean up, but insufficient for a thorough deep cleaning. It has a decent amount of suction to it that doesn't struggle at all with small stones and other road grit that ends up in my floor mats. It pulls all the loose debris like that right up without batting an eyelash. It's the ground in dirt and debris this vacuum struggles with. It's not a lack of suction, it's a lack of a rotating brush head that you get on a Dirt Devil hand vac that digs into the carpet and knocks the dirt loose so it can be sucked up.\n\nThe brush attachment does a decent job of knocking some of that ground in grit loose with a little bit of elbow grease, but it's not like using a vac with a rotating brush head.\n\nThat said, this is great for getting up the loose dirt on the floor and cleaning out cup holders and the dirt and chunks of things that end up between and under your seats. So while it's not a deep cleaner, it's a good cleaner for in between the deep cleans.\n\nEverything fits in the bag, not just the vacuum.\n\nInitially I did think the filter was permanently affixed, which would have basically made this a one use machine. But it's just really stuck in the front cone that captures the dirt. I found that the extension attachment worked perfectly to loosen the filter. Just stick the extension attachment it in the front of the vacuum backwards so it slides all the way in and touches the filter cone and give it a tap. The filter pops right out the back of the clear cone piece. (Obviously, take the cone off the motor first). After that it goes back in hand tight and comes in and out easily.\n\nUltimately I like this thing. It's small enough to store in the trunk and powerful enough to clean up anything that's not ground into the floor mats and carpets. If you're looking to thoroughly clean your car, you'll be disappointed. If you have kids that leave crumbs and other debris all over your back seat, this is great for quickly and easily solving that problem.\n\nI was sent a sample of this product for the purpose of reviewing it.",

I also was surprised to see the nice carrying case for it, making sure it is protected and easy recognizable when you need it.\n\nThis is one of those items you will want to keep close by, because an accident can happen at any time.

    "reviewText": "This a phenomenal little emergency pen. The build quality is rock solid--it's a little tube of stainless steel. The magnetic cap is plenty strong. I keep it on my key chain, and the pen has never once come loose or fallen off. The magnet is strong enough to give you a very satisfying snap when you insert or remove the pen. Inadvertently detaching the pen is quite unlikely. At under 3 inches long, it fits nicely in my key chain with my car keys. You can use any standard multi-pen refill. I use Fisher Space Pen U1F or U4F universal refills.\n\n----------------------\nEDIT: March 15, 2016\n\nSo this is still the best tiny keychain pen. The magnetization on the cap is strong and solid, and the pen is shorter than my car key. However, there are a few changes to the design since I last ordered this pen in late 2014. These details are noted below and in the pictures that I have uploaded.\n\nFirst, the picopen has increased in length from a bit over 3\" to now a bit over 3.25\". In addition, the thickness of the pen has increased from what used to be approximately the thickness of a standard USB cable to what is now just shy of the thickness of a 6.35 mm audio jack... or a little bit bigger than the grounding prong of a three-prong electrical plug (sorry, I don't have a caliper handy for better measurements).\n\nSecond, the design of the top of the pen has changed slightly. As can be seen in my pictures, the older Picopen had a tiny lip at the top of the pen, where it connected with the cap. The newer design is a smooth cylinder.\n\nThird, the cap design has changed quite substantially. In the older design, a magnet was attached just inside the cap rather shallowly. When you put the cap onto the pen, the magnet inside the cap gripped onto the lip of the pen (see pictures). With the newer design, the cap is nearly twice as long, and the magnet is recessed much deeper within the cap. Because of the recessed design, the newer cap slides down the shaft of the pen nearly a quarter inch more. Also, as far as I can tell, the magnet on the newer pen is a fair bit stronger than on the old pen. These design choices make it much less likely for the pen to accidentally become detached and fall off your keychain (though that never was a problem for me with the old pen).\n\nFourth, the mechanism for gripping the ink refill has changed on the new pen. On the old pen, the refill just slides in. It's a lightly firm fit, but it feels as though you're just sliding the ink refill into a cylindrical metal tube. You slide the refill in all the way until it hits the back of the pen and stops. The new pen is quite a bit different. Though I am unable to see inside the shaft of the new pen, it feels as though there is a spring that grips the ink refill as you slide it in. The spring resists the ink refill from going into the pen shaft at the very top, but once you have the refill in a little bit, it slides in very firmly. When the ink refill is inserted all the way, pushing on the top of the refill reveals a little bit of springiness. I'm sure everyone has used a retractable pen at some point in their life that, when they press down on a piece of paper, the ink refill has a very small amount of give/springiness. The new Picopen is like that, whereas the refill in the old Picopen is rock solid and has no give. I assume there is probably a small spring underneath of the ink refill that you compress as you push it in which causes this.\n\nFifth, as mentioned above, I use Fisher Space Pen U1F/U4F pressurized refills for my Picopen. Even though the U1F/U4F are standard multipen sizes and are almost exactly the same size as the ink refill that comes with the Picopen, the refill gripping mechanism in the new Picopen strongly resists accepting the Fisher refills. You have to wiggle and push the Fisher refills pretty hard to get them past the initial resistance of the new Picopen before they will slide in, and as you do so, it feels as though you might break whatever spring is inside of the new Picopen. Perhaps this problem will fade with time as you put some wear and tear on the new Picopen. I suspect that reason for the difficulty in getting the Fisher pen refills into the new Picopen is because the tip of the Fisher refills are capped--since they're pressurized--whereas the ink refill that comes with the Picopen has a hollow end (see pictures).",

BUT it is clear that they took an old book and just added some new car models to the tables in the back and reissued it.  The coverage of R-134a is totally inadequate.  The varous pressure/temperature tables are unlabeled but presumably apply only to R-12.  The instructions for charging are aimed at R-12 and only use the bulk containers.  Charging with R-134a (which is legal) is addressed by telling you to drive to a commercial shop and paying them to do it.  There is no info on charging from small cans.  There is no comparison of liquid and vapor charging.  Very disappointing.  P.S.  I love the Haynes manual for my Jaguar XJ6 so don't let me scare you off Haynes.",

You can usually overcome this with some common sense, but i have found several times wishing i new exactly where something was rather then them assuming i know where it is.\n- Lacks discussion on common problems encountered during repairs.

Steering dampener is a part that you have to replace after 20K miles, so you would think... No I guess not. The pictures are dark, looking as if the pages were copied not printed, the wording is not clear and the book is way too expensive for what you get.

It is a great time-saver when you haven't done something before on that type of car.

As my review title states is comparable to a Chilton's. I bought it to replace my timing belt but haven't gotten around to it yet...will probably update this when I do. Although I've already printed a better walk thru from passatforum.com that I may use instead. A nice book to have if you do a lot of your own work, things like maintenance are included and explained well for the most part I do alot of maintenance so I'm sure it'll pay for itself. I was mad when I saw a brand new version on sale at Orielly's the day after I ordered it for $19.99...I paid $17 for this one and had to wait a wk for it to be delivered...also tried to find info on removing/replacing my secondary air injection pump for my emissions as I'm getting a emission CEL code and all it had to say about replacing the combi valve and SAIP was to SEE THE DEALER.

I recently took my car in to a garage because the check engine light came on. They read the trouble code from the computer, saw that it was related to the cooling system, and immediately recommended that I replace the water pump. And since I was replacing the water pump, I might as well replace the timing belt too. Total cost $2000! The book offers several no-cost/low-cost fixes to try first. This book also suggested replacing the valve core, to resolve a slow leak in a tire. I took the tire to two tire repair shops, and neither one suggested that. It might be because the valve cores cost 50 cents, whereas they could sell me another tire for a lot more. I no longer have any faith in the auto repair industry.\n\nAlong with this repair manual, I bought the Roadi RDT55 Diagnostic Trouble Code Reader for Volkswagen and Audi Vehicles with OBDII Vehicle Live Data. I'm very happy with that product too.",

    "reviewText": "There is really no substitute for the factory service manual.  I did get a copy of the factory manual - it runs about 15$ more than this if you get the electronic version (probably preferable to the paper copy actually - easier to search).  The haynes manual is a few hundred pages - factory manual is over 2000 pages!  So, this manual just won't be as complete.  That said - the haynes manual will probably do fine for most repairs.\n\nThe factory manual has diagrams, not pictures, so it's easier to see what the instructions want you to do, and where things are.  However, the pictures really aren't that bad in the Haynes manual.  To those that complain about it - get some reading glasses?  They seem perfectly good to me.\n\nI've seen lots of complaints about the paper being too thin in other reviews.  Sure, it's a bit thinner than perhaps the average book (maybe similar to a newspaper), but still perfectly usable.  If you are ripping the pages or pulling them out of the manual - my question to those that say this sort of thing - have you used a book before?\n\nI've done 3 recent services on our hondas\n\n1) Engine mount replacement\n2) radiator flush\n3) EGR valve replacement\n\nI used the factory manual instructions to do the mount replacement, but I checked the Haynes manual to see if it was what the factory would recommend.  Engine mount replacement details looked spot-on, it is just how I did it (and actually made the suggestion the factory manual did not - which was instead of using a lift, to support the engine with a floor jack under the oil pan - this worked perfectly for me).  The only thing that was a bit annoying is that you only seem to get the general bolt torque guidance in the front of the manual.  Factory manual specifies an exact desired value per-bolt on their diagrams.\n\nRadiator flush is just the same really as factory manual.\n\nEGR valve replacement was a snap - hardly worth mentioning.\n\nSo, from the recent work I've done, the Haynes manual is actually quite good, and lines up pretty well with what I see in the factory manual.  Seems to me that you should be able to perform most services to your car with this manual.  But, if you want the best of the best - you may want to go with the factory service manual (available on amazon).\n\nI give this 4/5 stars, as the factory manual isn't that much more, and is simply more complete.  Solid manual from what I can see though.",

Easily torn and very absorbent so the pages soil quickly. Information is good but they could provide a little more detail, especially in the illustrations, which are poor at best. Since it is supposed to be for the home mechanic, it might be nice to rate some of the jobs between easy and difficult, but I won't rate it down for that. What this manual did for me was convince me that I should have a pro do the job, and that saved me the frustration of starting a job I couldn't finish.",

In other words, Haynes expresses between 4cycl to 6cycl, 4x2 or 4x4 on repairs; where as Chilton is broad when it says Nissan pickup trucks; and doesn't break it down as far as all pickup trucks are the same; which they are not! Haynes in my opinion individualizes your vehicle; such as Xterra time frame to the frontier time, same chassis and engine. Chilton would have never told me about that, and not thinking of looking at Xterras, only specially frontiers. Also, the price is significantly less with Haynes compare to Chilton.",

I can't imagine it will last too long if handled too much or if it gets wet/oily (i.e., survive the rigors of weekend mechanics!), so I'll need to be carefull with it.\n\nBut, the price was low and it should be adequate for basic maintenance like oil, filters, fluids, brakes, lighting, etc., and to learn about the way more complex systems work in my Audi. I would gladly have paid $10 more for a better quality printing though.",

Trying to pack to many vehicles in to one manual is a bad idea for starters. My biggest complaint is that once I had my engine back together I put on a new distributor, rotor, wires and plugs. According to the manual the #1 plug is located in the back. That seemed odd to me but since I took the wires off two weeks before and didn't pay attention to the firing order since I had a manual. After wasting several hours of my time I went to the Internet for answers. The first thing I found was several references to #1 being in the front right were I expected it should have been. After 2 minutes to switch the wires around the Jeep fired right up and sounds good. How can you publish a manual with a major error like that?",

Even the most seasoned DIY owner can be thrown off by the unfamiliar designs of their new car and owner's manuals can often be lacking in certain critical areas (and as seems to be the very bizarre case with Audi A4s of the B6 and B7 generation, the owner's manuals oftentimes seem to just be lacking- as in totally absent from the car. It's a very well known thing... check it out), so something which goes into deeper detail is a must. Having all the torque specs, gap settings, bolt types, fluid levels, OEM part numbers, etc., a book like this is essential. As simple as Google is to use, it can be frustrating to try and look up torque specs on a car that is known for having a gang of gnomes seemingly roaming around stealing the manuals, then you go onto a forum, ask what the torque specs are, and the first reply you get is \"Read the manual\"\n\nEven in cases where the manual is there, 99% of what is contained within the pages of the Haynes manual isn't there. If you're just looking to change the plugs and belt on your car, this is the manual for you. If you're looking to rebuild the head and you're comfortable with the job- this is the manual for you.",

I liked the detail and the photographs.\n\nHowever, I found some key information missing in this manual.  First, the newer CR-Vs use a \"Maintenance Minder\" to assist in performing ongoing maintenance (belts, fluids, tire rotation, etc).  However, there is no mention of the MM in this manual.  Second, changing the rear differential fluid is part of the ongoing maintenance schedule for 4WD CR-Vs.  This is definitely a DIY project.  However, the manual dedicates only a few overview paragraphs on this, with no photographs.  There is a drain hole and a fill hole, but no mention of where they are located.  The drain plugs are removed with the square end of a 3/8\" ratchet, but no mention of this.  Finally, Honda recommends new crush washers (oil changes too), but again, no mention of this.\n\nI did find numerous photographs and gory details on tearing down and rebuilding the engine, if that's what you're up to.",

I own a 2002 CR-V, this manual favors civics in it's repair instructions and pictures.  I would like to see a CR-V specific repair manual made by Haynes. I will use an example.  I wanted to replace the starter, or at least take it out to test it.  The repair manual stated that all I needed to do was remove four bolts and viola, I would have my starter out.  What the manual failed to mention was that the exhaust manifold had to be first taken out (I found this out from online forums;) no where in this manual did that important fact be mentioned.

    "reviewText": "I've used Haynes' and Chilton's books for years, but this isn't their best effort.  I have a few big complaints.\n\n1) A very, very great deal of information is generic automotive data that's probably copied and pasted between all their books, and in a couple of instances, I found some of this generic information that wasn't particularly correct in the case of Civics.\n\n2) The book spreads itself across multiple *generations* of Civics and Civic body styles AND tries to tackle CRVs at the same time.  It's just spread too thin.  It's sometimes difficult to hone in on the data that's appropriate for your vehicle.  It doesn't seem to cover Si's at all.\n\n3) I hate to disagree with most of the other reviews, but the book doesn't dig very deep.  Too many systems explanations give only a cursory overview, 101 level troubleshooting (check the fuses, check the seals), then we're admonished to take the car to a dealer if we still have issues.  This is the treatment given for systems as simple as the power locks and emissions.\n\nIf you're only doing simple tune-up work, and you're maybe after an easy-difficulty repair or two, this book might work.  If really want to learn about your car in depth, or you want to make sure you don't get caught short in the middle of a job with insufficient or incomplete information, or if you're going to take on more difficult jobs, you'll want a better book.\n\nFor about 20 bucks more, you can have the complete factory shop manuals right here on Amazon, and they're on CD so you can search the contents and print what you want before attempting a job.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/2006-2007-2008-2009-Honda-Civic-Shop-Manual-CD-W-Etm/dp/B0042XGGCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">2006 2007 2008 2009 Honda Civic Shop Manual CD W/Etm</a>\n\nBishko reprints the Honda official manuals on CD, and you'll have the exact information for your particular car.  All of it.  Enough to tear down the engine and transmission and build it back up to factory specs.  And anything else you can imagine.\n\nGranted, factory service manuals sometimes assume you have access to tools and equipment you either don't have or can't get at all, but I'd rather read, know, and understand than be told \"this is over your head, take it to the dealer\".  Often times, specialized tools can be improvised, or Internet forum wisdom can help you work around your lack of factory test equipment.\n\nAgain, the book isn't terrible, I just expect considerable depth in a repair manual, and felt like I got something that was basically a little better than the owner's manual.  If that's all you're after, perhaps this book is fine.  If not, you have other affordable options.",

I have compared a factory repair manual to Haynes on Chevy Astros and I found serious incorrect information  on front suspension disassembly procedure that not only doesn't work but damaging the front coil springs. The authors of these books seem to presume one size fits all ( or in this case all front coil spring suspensions are the same) As far as this repair manual for the HHR they have left out views of the engine compartment with the sheet metal body parts removed or drawings depicting areas that can't be photographed easily. They use to include this in their older manuals. Also in flipping through this book I noticed several Toyota pickup photos standing in for the HHR regarding cleaning the engine. Once again This is probably due to that pesky sheet  metal that with the large air filter housing  completely covers the engine.",

I was looking for a very simple information on spark plug replacement on my 4 cyl. 2010 Tacoma. The spark plugs are comcealed with a plastic cover, but there was no information on how to remove it. The manual also had pictures of worn spark plugs with eroded tips and instructions on gapping the tips. The spark plugs on most new Toyotas are the new type long life  iridium plugs with fine center wire and not recommended for regapping. Some of the black and white pictures in the book are very low quality with hard to see details.",

The pants fit just right and have a reinforced rear end for wear and tear and reinforced inner legs for engine heat.\n\nHere's what I was looking for and this suit had it:\nA full velcro flap on the front of the jacket.\nA velcro collar with a corduroy liner and a concealed hood\nVelcro cuffs\nA drawstring waist and jacket bottom\nHighly visible during reduced visibility rain storms\nThe pants come with bootstraps to keep them down and zippers by the cuffs to allow ease in putting on and taking off.\n3M reflective striping throughout the top and bottom\nSuspenders to keep the pant waistband up and under the coat.\n\nIf you get a one-piece suit you'll be most protected since there's no break in material.  If you have a two-piece suit you don't want rain coming in between the pants and the coat.  So it was important to me to find a set that had suspenders or a bib on the pants to keep them tucked up under the coat.  These do just that.\n\nAs for fit, I'm 5'11\" 185lbs.  I wear a medium in most clothing.  I wanted a suit that would fit over my clothes.  So I ordered a large.  A large on my frame fits over my jeans perfectly.  The rain coat fits perfectly over my leather jacket.  If I were to just wear the rain coat over my shirt, I would want a medium.  But because I always use my leather coat when riding, I needed a large size suit to go over my leather jacket.  The collar is the only snug part of the jacket.  It probably should be the only snug part anyway to keep rain from running down your neck.\n\nMobility is fine in the suit.  I can twist my torso and look over my shoulders with very mild resistance from the material.\n\nBottom line: This 2-piece suit is a good buy.  It has suspenders to keep the pants up.  It's high-visibility green.  It fits great over clothes and a leather jacket.  The inner mesh liner provides adequate breathability.  The price is reasonable compared to other competitors.  I have NOT rain tested this material.  But I'm familiar with the material in general and believe it will provide acceptable coverage.  The product claims to be seam-sealed so that no water will leak in.  If it ends up leaking one could easily buy some seam sealing glue from your local Camping store.",
