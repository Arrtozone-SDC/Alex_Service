I am reviewing solely on inspecting them.

Sure, you can buy some cheap 12 gauge or whatever at your local big box store. But I have personally been in situations where the cheap-o cables simply could not carry enough current to jump my vehicle. The cables were too thin to charge the battery in a reasonable amount of time, and could not carry enough juice to turn the starter.\n\nALWAYS buy 2 or 4 gauge. ALWAYS buy long cables. I don't care what anyone says. Cars are low voltage but high amperage. A starter cranking needs a TON of juice. Those dainty little WM cables will not cut it. Enter these cables.\n\nAt 4 gauge, these could probably jump a semi. At 20 feet, you can easily link two cars together even if one is in a difficult spot. When life happens, you do NOT want to be stuck somewhere with cables that aren't adequate.\n\nThese cables fit the bill. The handles also appear to be fairly durable, which is important. I have had cheaper cables have the insulation on the handles flake off. Makes for a painful jump.\n\nOverall I am impressed with the workmanship and specifications for the price.

For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a \"jump\" but also if they have jumper cables.  It's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.\n\nNext lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The \"booster car\" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren't electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.\n\nThe technical stuff.  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, you don't really need to know all of this, but I'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I'm not an electrican but I've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can't control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it's low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you'd be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a \"dead\" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn't as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman's terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it's 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we're trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.\n\nLets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the \"dead\" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don't attach it directly to the battery's NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...\n\nA couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!

But for me where they fall short is at the clamps and this type of clamp seems to be on MANY cables available today. I could not see it in the photos but the clamps are uneven at the ends because of the extra notch the manufacturer adds on one side to make it easier to connect to side terminal batteries. Also there are NO teeth on the end of the jaws so you HAVE to make your connection using the teeth on the sides of the jaws.  This does not sound like a big deal until you are in a tight situation and have to clamp onto a top post battery straight down, then you have an uneven clamp end and no teeth to grip the post.  I happen to also have a car (a domestic) with a remote mounted battery, not a HOT ROD or modified car, just a stock factory production car where the manufacturer could not fit the battery under the hood for space saving and design reasons and put it elsewhere in the car.  Remote batteries used to be a rare thing on mostly European cars but it is fairly common now on all makes of cars.  With the battery not under the hood or in the trunk I have a Pos. and Neg. lug under the hood at the end of battery cables to jump the car with.  The Pos. lug is surrounded by plastic in a depression to prevent anything from accidentally hitting it and shorting.  Because of this there is little room and I can not get the side of these jumper cable clamps to grab the lug, I need teeth on the end of the jaws to grip the Pos. lug. I'm returning these cables and for $15 more (on sale) than the price of these cables I got the same length, the same 4 ga. wire, clamps with teeth on all 3 sides, even jaw ends, a side terminal connection in the jaws, and they came with a hard plastic storage case, safety glasses and gloves.

These are a heavy duty 4 gauge wire that will last for many years. In fact they might be the last jumper cables you ever have to buy. My vehicle as do most newer vehicles have side battery posts. These cables slip on them and lock in place, making a nice solid contact with no worry about sparks. For posts mounted on top of the battery it has a alligator type clamp on the end which will lock on tight, since the handle is spring loaded. This cable is 16 ft long for easy access for cars, SUV's and smaller trucks. If you have a larger truck or motor home you might want to consider longer cables.\n\nI also \" as Reviewer George C writes \" had cheap jumper cables literally melt when using them, it is not unusual for cheap bargain basement cables to do this.

Motor is quiet and easy to install.\n***UPDATE*** 5/21/2016\nInstall it on June 4, 2015. It was working great during the summer. My attic gets very hot and the motor seems to be on constantly. Then this year, May 18, 2016, I went up to my attic and it was hot, over 95 degree. I set my thermostat to 90 and it wasn't working. Checked the current and it was getting electricity. Motor died. Call CSH Inc. who was the seller through Amazon. They were very nice and explained that I had to go through Amazon for the 1year warranty even though they were the seller since I bought it through Amazon Prime. CSH said to call them back if Amazon didn't help and they would help me. Amazon said they don't do warranty but would take it back with a 15% restocking fee. Amazon said I could call the manufacturer for the warranty. So I called Lomanco and they honored the warranty with no problem. They asked for the model #, manufacturing date which is in the motor but I didn't know it - I give them the date on the box and when I bought. They sent me a new replacement one. I didn't have to send back the defective one. I received it in 5 days, call Monday received it Saturday. Excellent customer service, excellent warranty.

You can reuse the fan blade as long as you don't bend it (as in permanently crease it) when extracting the motor from the suspension bracket. Just make sure the fan is relatively balanced, meaning the blades are uniformly shaped from one to the other, before mounting the fan to the new motor. You can set the fan blade on a flat workbench or concrete floor and spin it to evaluate its balance. They're pretty easy to bend back into shape.\n\nTip: I found that it's easier to remove and install the motor with the fan already firmly attached, because access is limited to the Allen set screw once the motor and fan are up in the bracket.

They do make a difference. I have replaced three of these motors since 1985. They probably were good but I didn't know it. These motors are open shaded pole 42 frame motors. They have an oiler wick in the front and rear. There are no bearings. Because of the heat in your attic, the wicks dry. They need to be oiled regularly. Who wants to climb into the attic with 110 degrees in the summer heat and oil your fan motor? Then again, don't they always fail in the summer? These motors, I discovered, don't burn out, they seize on the shaft due to lack of oil, the overload protector overheats, then it turns itself off. But alas, these motors can be fixed. Here's how:\n\nBuy two of these motors to keep on hand. The price keeps rising so you might as well get them now. Attach some bright yellow plastic tape to the outside mushroom cover vent of your attic ventilator so when the tape is moving, the motor is on and running so you can see it from the ground. The next time your vent motor stops when it should be running, the tape will notify you then you'll have to climb into the attic to remove the motor. Remove the set screw on the motor shaft and the three bolts holding the motor to the bracket. Leave the fan blade. Disconnect motor wires from thermostat box and leave attic.\n\nWhat we want to do here is replace the seized motor with the new one but attach longer wires to it and the thermostat box so we can replace the motor next time by removing the mushroom cover on the roof pulling the motor up and out, unplugging it and not have to go into a hot attic to do it again. I use 14 GA. male/female plastic covered push connectors on the wire ends so I can easily unplug them.\n\nYour old motor can be fixed. Run a continuity test with ohmmeter on it. If it has continuity, the shaft/stator is seized. Remove the four bolts from the seized motor and separate the housing. The back part will easily separate. The stator will be seized to the front. Fill coffee can with WD-40 and soak front motor and stator for an hour. Remove and twist stator and front motor housing until stator separates. Clean stator shafts with 0000 steel wool, lube shafts with lithium grease and reassemble. Dun. zoz", "summary": "I'm a FAN of these", "unixReviewTime": 1308787200}

Use needle nose pliers to loosen stuck fuel lines. Work them back and forth to loosen it. Check the compression occaisionly to detect leaking valves.
